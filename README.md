## Abstract
The emergence of online social media has created numerous opportunities for individuals to share ideas within communities centered around areas of interest. In the mid-2000s, online forum culture grew rapidly as a result. One such example is Reddit, a bulletin-board-like platform built in 2005 to scale the forum world. At first, content seeded on Reddit was curated and broad. The very first "subreddit" to exist was the entire website. As Reddit later launched user-created subreddits, targeted sub-communities materialized around topics of interest. We aim to model this trend toward specificity using a structure-based analysis on relevance of posts within sub-communities.
